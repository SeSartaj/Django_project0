# Django Simple Apps (v1.0)

In this project I have implemented two very simple **Django** apps (to learn basics of Django). These apps are: 
  - Is New Year's?: Users can visit this web-app in order to know whether it is new year (or not)?
  - Todo List: A minimalist todo list where users can add tasks.
